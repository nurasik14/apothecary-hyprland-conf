# Apothecary Hyprland — 薬屋のひとりごと

A Hyprland desktop theme built around **Maomao** from *The Apothecary Diaries* (薬屋のひとりごと):
the desktop is her workbench in the Rear Palace — rice paper, sumi ink, lacquer, herbs and the red seal
of the inner court. Two moods, switchable live:

| mode | | feel |
|---|---|---|
| `light` | Apothecary 薬屋 | rice-paper cream, sumi ink, celadon green, a touch of vermilion and gold |
| `dark` | Inner Palace 后宫 | night lacquer, vermilion, antique gold, jade, paper-cream text |

## A theme system you can switch on and off

Apothecary Hyprland is a **theme system**, not a replacement set of dotfiles. It sits as a layer on top of
[JaKooLit's Fedora-Hyprland dotfiles](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Fedora-Hyprland): nothing of the base config is
edited in place, and one command switches the whole theme on or off in the running session, without logging out.

```sh
apothecary on       # theme on: Hyprland layer, Quickshell shell, hyprlock/hypridle, app themes, wallpaper
apothecary off      # theme off: the stock JaKooLit desktop comes back (~5 s)
apothecary status   # which state you are in
```

How the switch works:

- `scripts/install.sh` adds a single line to `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` that sources `hypr/apothecary.conf`.
  That file sources `~/.config/apothecary/active.conf`, a symlink the CLI points at `hypr/on.conf` (the theme) or
  `hypr/off.conf` (empty) and then runs `hyprctl reload`.
- **On** also stops waybar and the notification daemon, starts the Quickshell shell (`qs -c apothecary`), swaps in
  the theme's hyprlock and hypridle configs, sets the mode's wallpaper and applies the matching app themes.
- **Off** reverses every one of those steps: waybar, swaync/mako, the stock hypridle, your original
  `hyprlock.conf`, GTK settings, kitty colours and your previous wallpaper all come back.
- The choice survives logout and reboot (`~/.config/apothecary/enabled` marks it on; with the marker gone the
  login hook does nothing).
- Light/dark (`SUPER+T`) is a separate switch *inside* the theme. Use it while the theme is on; run while it is off,
  it still changes the wallpaper and app colours.
- Off is not uninstall: `scripts/uninstall.sh` removes the hook, links and app files completely. The SDDM login
  theme is installed separately with sudo and is not affected by on/off (see
  [docs/SUDO-STEPS.md](docs/SUDO-STEPS.md)).

## Art and credits

Character art from the light novels (Touko Shino), manga (Nekokurage) and anime (TOHO animation / OLM) is
**not** included in this repository; `assets/fetch-art.sh` downloads it for personal use and
`scripts/make-wallpapers.sh` composes the wallpapers locally. Public-domain herb plates (植物名實圖考), generated
textures, synthesized sounds and the quote sources are listed in [assets/CREDITS.md](assets/CREDITS.md).
Layout inspiration: qxb3's "ink" rice and end-4's dots-hyprland (no files copied).

The process notes in `docs/agent-prompts/`, `docs/STATUS.md` and `qa/` are the build log: the theme was designed and
implemented by a team of AI agents (Hermes + Claude) under the owner's direction, then QA-tested on real hardware.
