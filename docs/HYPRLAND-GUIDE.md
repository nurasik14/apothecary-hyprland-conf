# Maomao's Workbench: a Hyprland field guide

> **Theme system, switchable.** Apothecary Hyprland is a theme system layered on top of the JaKooLit
> Hyprland dotfiles, not a replacement for them. Turn it on with `apothecary on` and off with `apothecary off`
> (the stock desktop returns in about 5 s, no logout); `apothecary status` shows which state is active.
> The Apothecary binds and panels in this guide need the theme on; the JaKooLit parts work in both states. How the switch works: [README](../README.md#a-theme-system-you-can-switch-on-and-off).

> *"Poison or medicine, it all depends on the dose."* The same goes for keybinds.

This guide covers what Hyprland can do **on this machine**: Hyprland 0.56.2 on Fedora 44 with
JaKooLit/KoolDots dotfiles in `~/.config/hypr` and the Apothecary theme layer from this repo on top. I checked
every key here against the live bind list (`hyprctl binds -j`) and the config files it comes from. If a key
isn't in this guide, it isn't bound.

Notation: `SUPER` is the Windows key. `SUPER+SHIFT+Space` means hold SUPER and SHIFT, then tap Space.
"Number row" means the `1 … 0` keys above the letters (`0` is workspace 10).

## 1. The mental model in 10 lines

1. **Hyprland is the compositor.** It draws every window, owns every keybind and runs the animations. There's no separate "desktop".
2. **Windows tile by default.** New windows split the space with the ones already there (the *dwindle* layout). Nothing overlaps.
3. **A floating window** leaves the tiling and behaves like a normal desktop window: you can move it, resize it, and let it overlap others.
4. **Workspaces 1–10** are separate desks. A workspace only exists while it has windows (or while you're on it).
5. **The special workspace** (scratchpad) is a hidden drawer that slides down over whatever desk you're on, then hides again.
6. **Layers** sit outside the tiling: the 36 px bar, notifications, the launcher and the desktop widget cards. Quickshell (`qs -c apothecary`) draws all of these, not waybar.
7. **JaKooLit** supplies the base: keybinds, scripts and rofi menus in `~/.config/hypr/configs` and `scripts/`.
8. **The Apothecary layer** loads *last* (`hypr/on.conf`). It overrides decorations, animations, rules and some keys, and swaps waybar/swaync for the Quickshell shell.
9. **`apothecary off`** returns the stock JaKooLit desktop without logging out. `apothecary on` brings the workbench back.
10. **When in doubt**, run `hyprctl binds` (the live truth) or `apothecary repair` (`SUPER+ALT+R`).

## 2. Window management

### 2.1 Focus, move, swap

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+←/→/↑/↓` | Focus the neighbour in that direction (layout-aware script) |
| `SUPER+J` / `SUPER+K` | Focus the next / previous window (layout-aware) |
| `ALT+Tab` | Focus the next window and raise it (good for overlapping floats) |
| `SUPER+CTRL+S` | Window switcher (rofi list of every window) |
| `SUPER+CTRL+←/→/↑/↓` | **Move** the window in that direction (it takes a new slot) |
| `SUPER+ALT+←/→/↑/↓` | **Swap** places with the neighbour |
| `SUPER+Q` | Close politely (like clicking ×) |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+Q` | `kill` the window's process (`KillActiveProcess.sh`) for frozen apps |

Focus follows the mouse (`input:follow_mouse = 1`): hover over a window to focus it.

### 2.2 Resize

| How | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+SHIFT+←/→` | Width −50 / +50 px (hold to repeat) |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+↑/↓` | Height −50 / +50 px (hold to repeat) |
| `SUPER` + **right**-drag | Free resize with the mouse (`bindm SUPER, mouse:273`) |
| `SUPER` + **left**-drag | Move with the mouse (`bindm SUPER, mouse:272`). A tiled window gets re-slotted where you drop it |
| Drag a window **border** | Resize without a modifier (`resize_on_border = true`) |

On a tiled window, resizing moves the split line between it and its neighbours. On a floating window it changes
the window itself.

### 2.3 "What happened to SUPER+Space? How do I float a window and resize it freely?"

While the theme is on, `SUPER+Space` opens the launcher. **Floating moved to `SUPER+SHIFT+Space`.** To float a
window and resize it freely:

1. Focus it and press **`SUPER+SHIFT+Space`**. It pops out of the tiling and floats.
2. Resize it with **`SUPER` + right-drag** anywhere inside the window, or grab the 2 px border and drag. Use `SUPER+SHIFT+arrows` for 50 px steps.
3. Move it with **`SUPER` + left-drag**.
4. Press `SUPER+SHIFT+Space` again to drop it back into the tiling.

Related:

| Key / gesture | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+ALT+Space` | Toggle floating on **every** window of the current workspace (`Float-all-Windows.sh`) |
| 4-finger swipe **down** (touchpad) | Toggle floating on the active window |
| `ALT+Tab` | Raise a floating window that got buried |

Some windows float automatically: superfile (70 % centred), pavucontrol, blueman, nm-connection-editor,
nwg-look, qt5ct/qt6ct/kvantum, and picture-in-picture (also pinned).

### 2.4 Fullscreen, maximize, pin, centre, opacity

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+F` | **Maximize** (`fullscreen 1`): fills the work area, and the bar stays visible |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+F` | **True fullscreen** (`fullscreen 0`): covers the bar. Fullscreen windows are 100 % opaque and undimmed |
| `SUPER+CTRL+O` | Make the active window fully opaque (toggle). Handy for photos and colour work |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+H` | Mute/unmute just this window's audio |
| *pin* | **No bind.** Run `hyprctl dispatch pin` (floating window stays on every workspace) or add a bind (§6.2) |
| *centre* | **No bind.** Run `hyprctl dispatch centerwindow`, or add one (§6.2) |

### 2.5 Groups (tabbed windows)

A group stacks several windows in one tile, with a tab bar on top. Click a tab to switch to it.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+ALT+G` | Turn the window into a group, or dissolve the group (was `SUPER+G` in JaKooLit) |
| `SUPER+CTRL+K` | Move the window into the group on its **left** ⚠ |
| `SUPER+CTRL+L` | Move the window into the group on its **right** |
| `SUPER+CTRL+H` | Take the window out of its group |
| `SUPER+CTRL+Tab` | Next tab in the group (the clean choice, see below) |
| `SUPER+Tab` / `SUPER+SHIFT+Tab` | Next / previous tab ⚠ |

⚠ **Two JaKooLit double-binds** (both binds fire, as I read the config):
- `SUPER+Tab` is bound to *next group tab* **and** *next workspace*, and `SUPER+SHIFT+Tab` to *previous tab* and *previous workspace*. So pressing it also jumps desks. Use `SUPER+CTRL+Tab` or click the tabs.
- `SUPER+CTRL+K` is *move into group left* **and** *Kitty theme selector*. Close the rofi menu with Esc. Don't pick a kitty theme while the Apothecary is on (§5.3).

### 2.6 Layouts: dwindle, master, scrolling, monocle

The default is **dwindle** (`general:layout = dwindle`). Workspaces **3 and 5 start in master**
(`~/.config/hypr/workspaces.conf`). You can change the layout of the current workspace at any time, and JaKooLit
remembers it (`PersistWorkspaceLayout.sh`).

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+ALT+1` | Dwindle: binary splits, each new window halves the focused one |
| `SUPER+ALT+2` | Master: one big "master" pane plus a stack (`mfact 0.55`, master on the left) |
| `SUPER+ALT+3` | Scrolling: a horizontal strip of columns (80 % wide) you scroll through |
| `SUPER+ALT+4` | Monocle: one window at a time, full size |
| `SUPER+ALT+L` | Cycle through the layouts (`ChangeLayout.sh toggle`) |

**Dwindle tools**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+CTRL+I` | Toggle split direction (side by side ↔ stacked) (was `SUPER+SHIFT+I`) |
| `SUPER+P` | Pseudo-tile: keeps the window's own size inside its tile |
| `SUPER+M` | Labelled "Set split ratio 0.3". It sends `splitratio 0.3`, which Hyprland treats as a relative +0.3 nudge. Use `SUPER+SHIFT+arrows` to fine-tune |

**Master tools**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+CTRL+Return` | Swap the focused window with the master |
| `SUPER+ALT+I` | Add a master (two windows share the big pane) (was `SUPER+I`) |
| `SUPER+CTRL+D` | Remove a master |

**Scrolling tools**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+R` | Cycle the column width preset |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+.` / `SUPER+SHIFT+,` | Move the window to the right / left column |
| `SUPER+ALT+.` / `SUPER+ALT+,` | Swap the whole column right / left |
| `SUPER+ALT+H` | Scroll direction: horizontal |
| `SUPER+ALT+V` | Scroll direction: vertical (**also** opens the clipboard menu, a JaKooLit double-bind) |
| `SUPER+ALT+S` | Toggle vertical ↔ horizontal |

---

## 3. Workspaces

### 3.1 Switching and moving

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+1…0` | Go to workspace 1–10. Press the current one again to bounce back to the previous desk (`workspace_back_and_forth`) |
| `SUPER+.` / `SUPER+,` | Next / previous existing workspace |
| `SUPER` + mouse wheel | Next / previous workspace |
| `SUPER+Tab` / `SUPER+SHIFT+Tab` | Next / previous workspace (also flips group tabs, see §2.5) |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+1…0` | Move the window **and follow** it |
| `SUPER+CTRL+1…0` | Move the window **silently** (you stay where you are) |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+[` / `SUPER+SHIFT+]` | Move the window to the previous / next workspace and follow |
| `SUPER+CTRL+[` / `SUPER+CTRL+]` | Same, silently |
| `SUPER+CTRL+F9…F12` | Push the whole workspace to the left/right/up/down monitor (only matters with an external screen) |

Bar: the ten workspaces show as 一 … 十. Click one to jump there, or scroll over them to cycle. Absent desks are
faint, occupied ones are inked, and the active one carries a red seal.

Plug in an HDMI monitor and the odd workspaces stay on the laptop while the even ones (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) move to
`HDMI-A-1` (`UserConfigs/WorkspaceMonitors.conf`).

### 3.2 The special workspace (scratchpad drawer)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+SHIFT+U` | Put the active window in the drawer |
| `SUPER+U` | Slide the drawer down / back up (`togglespecialworkspace`) |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+1…0` (while it's open) | Take a window back out to a normal workspace |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+Return` | **Drop-down terminal**: its own kitty in a separate `special:scratchpad`. Same key hides it again |

The drawer drops from the top (`slidevert`, 500 ms). It scales to 80 % and dims the desk behind it with a 35 %
blurred scrim.

### 3.3 Overview

| Key / gesture | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+A` | JaKooLit's Quickshell overview (`OverviewToggle.sh` → `qs ipc -c overview call overview toggle`) |
| 4-finger swipe **up** | Same overview |

### 3.4 Touchpad gestures (from `configs/SystemSettings.conf`)

| Gesture | Action |
|---|---|
| 3-finger swipe left/right | Switch workspace (inverted, swiping past the last one creates a new desk) |
| 3-finger swipe up / down | Zoom in ×1.5 / zoom out ÷1.5 (screen magnifier) |
| 4-finger swipe up | Overview |
| 4-finger swipe down | Toggle floating on the active window |

Also: tap-to-click, natural scrolling, and the touchpad turns off while you type. The touchpad on/off key
(`XF86TouchpadToggle`) runs `TouchPad.sh`.

### 3.5 Zoom / magnifier

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+ALT` + wheel down | Zoom in ×2 around the cursor |
| `SUPER+ALT` + wheel up | Zoom out ÷2 |
| reset | `hyprctl keyword cursor:zoom_factor 1` |

---

## 4. The Apothecary shell (Quickshell)

### 4.1 Keys

| Key | Surface |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+Space` / `SUPER+D` | **Launcher** 药柜 (medicine cabinet) |
| `SUPER+N` | **Network** 网 (Wi-Fi list, connect/forget, VPN, airplane) |
| `SUPER+Escape` | **Power** (lock 锁 · logout 出 · suspend 眠 · reboot 启 · shutdown 关) |
| `SUPER+W` | **Wallpaper picker** (handscroll of thumbnails) |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+W` | Next wallpaper |
| `CTRL+ALT+W` | Random wallpaper |
| `SUPER+I` or `SUPER+SHIFT+N` | **Notification centre** 报 |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+I` | Do not disturb on/off |
| `SUPER+T` | Light ↔ dark mode |
| `SUPER+G` | Desktop **widgets** on/off |
| `SUPER+B` | **Brew timer** start / pause |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+B` | Brew timer: start 25 minutes now |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+G` | **Game mode** on/off |
| `SUPER+ALT+R` | **Repair** the shell |
| `SUPER+E` | superfile (`spf`) in a floating kitty sheet |
| Volume / brightness keys | The Apothecary ink-slip OSD shows on top of JaKooLit's own handlers |

Every overlay closes with **Esc**, and keyboard focus goes back to your window. Only one overlay is open at a time.

### 4.2 Launcher tricks

- **Fuzzy search**: type part of an app name. Prefix matches win over word-start matches, which win over scattered letters.
- **Categories**: 全 All · 网 Internet · 工 Development · 画 Media · 书 Office · 器 System · 设 Settings.
- **`=` calculator**: `=2^10/3` or `=sqrt(2)*pi`. Enter copies the result to the clipboard.
- **`>` run**: `>pavucontrol` runs the rest through `sh -c`, detached.
- Open it pre-typed from anywhere: `qs -c apothecary ipc call launcher search "=12*7"`.

JaKooLit's rofi helpers are still bound: `SUPER+S` web search · `SUPER+ALT+C` rofi calculator · `SUPER+CTRL+S`
window switcher.

### 4.3 Power menu

The letters **L O S R P** jump to Lock, lOgout, Suspend, Reboot and Power off. Logout, Reboot and Shutdown need a
**second** Enter or click on the 印 Confirm seal, so you can't bump them by accident.

### 4.4 Widgets (`SUPER+G`)

Eight paper cards: Weather · Calendar · Music (MPRIS) · SysInfo · Brew timer · Cava · Herb of the day · Quote.

- **Move a card**: drag it by its title bar (the cursor turns into a hand). The position is saved.
- **Put one card back**: double-click its title bar.
- **Reset every card**: `qs -c apothecary ipc call widgets layout`.
- Herb card: left-click for the next herb, right-click for the previous. Quote card: click for a new quote.
- Visibility persists across logins (`~/.config/apothecary/widgets-visible`).

### 4.5 Notifications

Paper-note popups appear top-right. Hover pauses the timer, and clicking the body runs its default action.
Critical notes stay until dismissed and get a vermilion 印 stamp. The centre (`SUPER+I`) groups notes by app and
has DND and "clear all". DND also silences the notification sounds.

### 4.6 Light/dark, game mode, repair

- **`SUPER+T`** (`apothecary toggle`) switches the colours, the wallpaper (remembered per mode), the hyprlock palette and the kitty colours. It runs `hyprctl reload`, so any temporary `hyprctl keyword` tweak is lost.
- **`SUPER+SHIFT+G`** (`apothecary gamemode`) turns off animations, blur, shadows, gaps, rounding, opacity and dimming, sets the border to 1 px and hides the widgets. Press it again to restore everything, including whether the widgets were showing. Use this one, **not** JaKooLit's `GameMode.sh`, which would tear the theme down.
- **`SUPER+ALT+R`** (`apothecary repair`) stops waybar/mako again, restarts the shell and the overview, re-applies the wallpaper and reloads Hyprland.

### 4.7 The `apothecary` CLI

```
apothecary on | off | status
apothecary light | dark | toggle
apothecary wallpaper next | prev | random | current | pick | <path>
apothecary reload            # hyprctl reload + restart the shell
apothecary gamemode [on|off|toggle]
apothecary repair
```

### 4.8 Full IPC list (`qs -c apothecary ipc call <target> <fn>`)

| Target | Functions |
|---|---|
| `launcher` | `toggle` `open` `close` `search "<q>"` |
| `network` | `toggle` `open` `close` `rescan` `expand "<ssid>"` `connect "<ssid>"` (saved profiles only) |
| `power` | `toggle` `open` `close` |
| `wallpapers` | `toggle` `open` `close` `next` `prev` `apply` `select <index>` |
| `notifications` | `toggle` `open` `close` `dnd` `clear` `status` |
| `theme` | `toggle` `set light\|dark` `get` |
| `osd` | `volume` `brightness` |
| `widgets` | `toggle` `reveal` `hide` `layout` `demo on\|off` `status` (use `reveal`, because `show` collides with `qs ipc show`) |
| `brew` | `toggle` `start <minutes>` `reset` `status` |
| `shell` | `closeAll` `status` |

`qs -c apothecary ipc show` lists everything the running shell exposes.

## 5. JaKooLit extras worth knowing

### 5.1 Screenshots (saved to `~/Pictures/Screenshots` unless noted)

| Key | What |
|---|---|
| `Print` | Select an area → opens in **swappy** to annotate (your override in `UserKeybinds.conf`; not auto-saved, save from swappy) |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+S` | Area → swappy (`ScreenShot.sh --swappy`) |
| `SHIFT+ALT+S` | Region with hyprshot |
| `ALT+Print` / `ALT+F6` | Active window only |
| `SUPER+F6` | Whole screen now |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+F6` | Area |
| `SUPER+CTRL+F6` | Whole screen in 5 s |
| `SUPER+ALT+F6` / `SUPER+CTRL+SHIFT+Print` | Whole screen in 10 s |

### 5.2 Utilities

| Key | What |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+ALT+V` | Clipboard history (cliphist). Enter re-copies, `CTRL+Del` deletes an entry, `ALT+Del` wipes all |
| `SUPER+ALT+E` | Emoji picker |
| `SUPER+ALT+C` | Rofi calculator |
| `SUPER+S` | Web search (rofi → Google) |
| `SUPER+C` | SSH session menu (hosts from your ssh config) |
| `SUPER+Z` | Default browser (was `SUPER+B`) |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+M` | Online radio / music menu (RofiBeats) |
| `SUPER+CTRL+N` | Night light: hyprsunset at 4500 K, toggle (was `SUPER+N`) |
| `SUPER+ALT+O` | Toggle "less blur" ↔ "normal blur" (a temporary `hyprctl keyword`, see note) |
| `ALT+SHIFT` | Switch keyboard layout **us → ru → kz** (xkb `grp:alt_shift:toggle`, plus JaKooLit's `KeyboardLayout.sh` on `ALT+SHIFT_L` and a per-window switcher on `SHIFT+ALT_L`) |
| `SUPER+H` | KooL cheat sheet (yad). **Stale while themed**: it still lists `SUPER+B` browser, `SUPER+D` rofi, `SUPER+E` Thunar, `SUPER+T` theme switcher |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+K` | Searchable keybind list (rofi). Parses JaKooLit's files only, so it **misses the Apothecary binds** and shows the ones they replaced. Use this guide or `hyprctl binds` |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+E` | KooL Quick Settings (edit user configs, nwg-displays, nwg-look, qt6ct…) ⚠ some items |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+O` | Change oh-my-zsh theme |
| `CTRL+ALT+P` | wlogout (JaKooLit's power screen; the Apothecary one is `SUPER+Escape`) |
| `CTRL+ALT+L` | Lock (see §6.7) |
| `CTRL+ALT+Delete` | **Exits Hyprland immediately, with no confirmation** (`Logout.sh`) |

Note on `SUPER+ALT+O`: the blur script checks for the stock 2 passes. The theme uses 3, so the first press sets
"normal" (size 5, passes 2). Either way, `hyprctl reload` or `SUPER+T` brings back the theme's blur.

### 5.3 Media and Fn keys

| Key | What |
|---|---|
| Volume up/down/mute | `Volume.sh` + Apothecary OSD (`ALT` + volume = fine steps) |
| Mic mute | Toggle mic |
| Play/Pause/Next/Prev/Stop | `MediaCtrl.sh` (playerctl) |
| Brightness up/down | `Brightness.sh` + OSD. **Needs the kernel-parameter fix** (§8) |
| Keyboard backlight up/down | `BrightnessKbd.sh` |
| Sleep key | `systemctl suspend` |
| Rfkill key | Airplane mode |
| `XF86Launch1/3/4` | Bound to ASUS tools (`rog-control-center`, `asusctl`). Leftovers that probably do nothing on this Acer |

### 5.4 ⚠ JaKooLit keys that fight the theme

The theme already **unbound** the worst ones: `SUPER+W` wallpaper menu, `SUPER+SHIFT+W` effects, `SUPER+T`
ThemeChanger, `SUPER+SHIFT+G` GameMode.sh, `SUPER+ALT+R` Refresh.sh, `CTRL+ALT+W` WallpaperRandom.sh,
`SUPER+CTRL+B` / `SUPER+ALT+B` waybar style/layout menus, and `SUPER+SHIFT+B` rainbow borders. These are
**still bound** and can still damage the theme:

| Key | Why it hurts | Use instead |
|---|---|---|
| `SUPER+SHIFT+A` animations menu | Overwrites `UserAnimations.conf` and runs `RefreshNoWaybar.sh`, which **kills `qs`** (bar and widgets vanish) | Theme curves in `hypr/animations.conf`. Afterwards: `SUPER+ALT+R` |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+E` Quick Settings → rainbow borders / waybar toggles | Run `Refresh.sh`: restarts waybar, kills `qs` | `SUPER+ALT+R` afterwards. Editing config files from the menu is fine |
| `SUPER+CTRL+K` kitty theme selector | Rewrites kitty's theme include and calls wallust (Apothecary colours are included later in `kitty.conf`, but don't push it) | `SUPER+T` switches kitty with the mode |
| `SUPER+CTRL+G` ghostty themes | Wallust-based, same story | n/a |
| `SUPER+CTRL+ALT+B` toggle waybar | Waybar is stopped while themed. If it shows up, that's the bug | `SUPER+ALT+R` |
| `SUPER+ALT+O` blur toggle | Temporary, harmless | `SUPER+T` / reload restores |
| Running `WallpaperSelect.sh`, `WallustSwww.sh`, `WallpaperRandom.sh`, `ThemeChanger.sh`, `DarkLight.sh`, `GameMode.sh`, `Refresh.sh` by hand | Reset the wallpaper, run wallust, restart waybar | `SUPER+W`, `CTRL+ALT+W`, `SUPER+T`, `SUPER+SHIFT+G`, `SUPER+ALT+R` |

`SUPER+CTRL+R` / `SUPER+CTRL+SHIFT+R` (rofi theme selectors) only restyle rofi menus, which is harmless.

## 6. Power-user corner

### 6.1 `hyprctl` cheat sheet

Run `source ~/Projects/apothecary-hyprland/scripts/dev-env.sh` first if a shell (e.g. one started by the gateway) can't reach Hyprland.

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `hyprctl clients` | Every window: class, title, workspace, floating, size |
| `hyprctl activewindow` | The focused window. **Use this to find a `class` for rules** |
| `hyprctl activeworkspace` / `workspaces` / `monitors` | Where am I, what exists, screen info |
| `hyprctl binds` (`-j` for JSON) | Live keybinds with descriptions, the authoritative list |
| `hyprctl dispatch <dispatcher> <arg>` | Do any action: `hyprctl dispatch pin`, `… centerwindow`, `… workspace 4`, `… togglefloating` |
| `hyprctl keyword <option> <value>` | Temporary change: `hyprctl keyword general:gaps_out 4`. Lost on reload / `SUPER+T` |
| `hyprctl getoption <option>` | Read a value: `hyprctl getoption decoration:active_opacity` |
| `hyprctl reload` | Re-read all config files |
| `hyprctl configerrors` | Show config errors after you edit something (empty = good) |
| `hyprctl switchxkblayout <kbd> next` | Change keyboard layout |
| `hyprctl dispatch exit` | Log out |

Find free key combos before you bind one:

```bash
hyprctl binds -j | jq -r '.[] | "\(.modmask) \(.key)  \(.description)"' | sort
# modmask bits: SHIFT=1 CAPS=2 CTRL=4 ALT=8 SUPER=64  (SUPER+SHIFT = 65, SUPER+CTRL = 68, SUPER+ALT = 72)
```

### 6.2 Your own binds and window rules

- **Binds** go in `~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/UserKeybinds.conf`.
- **Window rules** go in `~/.config/hypr/UserConfigs/WindowRules.conf` (empty, made for you).

The theme never edits these files, so your additions survive `apothecary on/off`. One catch: the theme layer is
sourced **after** them. If you bind a key the theme also uses, the theme wins while it's on. These were free at
the time of writing: `SUPER+X`, `SUPER+Y`, `SUPER+O`, `SUPER+V`.

```ini
# UserKeybinds.conf: bindd = MODS, key, description, dispatcher, arg
bindd = SUPER, Y, Pin floating window, pin
bindd = SUPER, X, Centre floating window, centerwindow
bindd = SUPER, O, Obsidian, exec, obsidian
bindd = SUPER SHIFT, X, Float + centre + 60%, exec, hyprctl --batch "dispatch setfloating; dispatch resizeactive exact 60% 60%; dispatch centerwindow"
# replace a JaKooLit bind: unbind first, with the key spelled exactly as in configs/Keybinds.conf
unbind = SUPER, C
bindd = SUPER, C, Calculator app, exec, gnome-calculator
```

```ini
# WindowRules.conf: Hyprland 0.56 syntax  windowrule = match:<prop> <regex>, <effect> <value>, ...
windowrule = match:class ^(org.gnome.Calculator)$, float on, center on, size 420 640
windowrule = match:class ^(Spotify|spotify)$, workspace 9 silent
windowrule = match:class ^(obsidian)$, opacity 1.0 1.0

```

After editing, run `hyprctl reload && hyprctl configerrors`. The theme's own rules (`hypr/rules.conf`) are sourced
later and win on conflicts (superfile, pavucontrol, video players, PiP).

### 6.3 Monitor and scaling

`~/.config/hypr/monitors.conf` has `monitor=,preferred,auto,1` (eDP-1 runs at 1920×1080@165, scale 1).

```bash
hyprctl keyword monitor eDP-1,1920x1080@165,0x0,1.25   # try 125 % scaling (temporary)
hyprctl keyword monitor eDP-1,1920x1080@60,0x0,1       # 60 Hz to save battery (temporary)
```

To keep a setting, put the same line in `monitors.conf`, or use Quick Settings → *Configure Monitors
(nwg-displays)*. XWayland apps use `force_zero_scaling`, so they stay sharp but may look small at fractional scales.

### 6.4 Animations (ink on wet paper)

The theme's three curves (`hypr/animations.conf`): no bounce, no overshoot.

| Curve | Bezier | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `ink` | 0.22, 1, 0.36, 1 (ease-out quint) | Windows opening (700 ms popin 85 %), layers appearing |
| `brush` | 0.65, 0, 0.35, 1 (ease-in-out cubic) | Window close (600 ms), all fades (500 ms) |
| `drift` | 0.33, 1, 0.68, 1 (ease-out cubic) | Window moves (600 ms), **workspaces 400 ms slide**, scratchpad 500 ms slidevert |

Borders don't animate (no rotating gradient). Try a value temporarily, for example
`hyprctl keyword animation workspaces,1,2,drift,slide`. Turn everything off with
`hyprctl keyword animations:enabled 0`, or press game mode.

### 6.5 Opacity, blur and dim

| Knob | Theme value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `decoration:active_opacity` | 0.94 | Thin paper: the blurred wallpaper peeks through |
| `decoration:inactive_opacity` | 0.88 | |
| `decoration:dim_inactive` / `dim_strength` | on / 0.06 | A whisper of ink wash |
| `decoration:dim_special` | 0.35 | Scrim behind the scratchpad |
| `decoration:blur` | size 6, passes 3, vibrancy 0.17 | Also behind popups and the special workspace |
| kitty `background_opacity` | 0.88 | Stacks with the compositor's opacity |
| `general` | border 2, gaps 6/12, rounding 8 | |
| Video players, fullscreen | 1.0, no blur | Picture stays crisp |

Quick fixes: `SUPER+CTRL+O` makes one window opaque, and `hyprctl keyword decoration:inactive_opacity 1` is a
temporary global change. To make a change permanent, use a window rule (§6.2).

### 6.6 hypridle (theme on)

| After | Happens |
|---|---|
| 5 min | Dim the backlight to 30 % (a no-op until the backlight fix, §8) |
| 10 min | Lock (`loginctl lock-session` → Apothecary hyprlock) |
| 15 min | Screen off; any input wakes it |
| Before sleep | Lock |

Video players and browsers can inhibit idle. With `apothecary off`, the stock JaKooLit hypridle comes back.

### 6.7 hyprlock

`CTRL+ALT+L` → `loginctl lock-session` → hypridle's `lock_cmd` → `hyprlock -c <repo>/hypr/hyprlock.conf`.
`~/.config/hypr/hyprlock.conf` is a symlink to the theme's file while the theme is on. The colours follow light/dark
mode, and a 時辰 (Chinese hour) label updates every minute. Type your password and press Enter.

## 7. Daily rhythm (a suggested routine)

1. `SUPER+Return` for a terminal, `SUPER+Space` for anything else.
2. Desk 1 for work, 2 for the browser, 3 and 5 for master-layout coding, 9 for music. Move things with `SUPER+SHIFT+n`.
3. Put a notes app or terminal in the drawer: `SUPER+SHIFT+U`, then call it with `SUPER+U`.
4. `SUPER+SHIFT+B` to brew a 25-minute focus session, `SUPER+SHIFT+I` to silence notes while it runs.
5. `SUPER+T` at sunset, `SUPER+CTRL+N` for warm night light.
6. Before gaming: `SUPER+SHIFT+G`. After: `SUPER+SHIFT+G` again.

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Waybar came back / two bars / bar gone / widgets gone | `apothecary repair` (`SUPER+ALT+R`). Usually a JaKooLit script ran `Refresh.sh` (§5.4) |
| `SUPER+G` (or another theme key) does nothing | The shell died or was killed: `SUPER+ALT+R`. Check that the bind exists: `hyprctl binds \| grep -i widgets` |
| Wallpaper reset to a JaKooLit one | `SUPER+ALT+R`, or pick one with `SUPER+W` |
| Widget cards scattered | `qs -c apothecary ipc call widgets layout` (or double-click each title bar) |
| A theme tweak "didn't stick" | `hyprctl keyword` changes are temporary. `SUPER+T` and reloads wipe them. Put it in a config file |
| Text colours wrong in a TUI (btop, nvim…) after `SUPER+T` | Restart that program. Running TUIs keep the old palette |
| Everything looks stock JaKooLit | Theme is off: `apothecary on`. Check with `apothecary status` |
| Want the stock desktop back | `apothecary off` (no logout needed) |
| Game mode stuck on | `apothecary gamemode off` |
| Brightness keys / OSD say "no backlight device" | Remove `acpi_backlight=vendor`: see `docs/SUDO-STEPS.md` → *Screen brightness* (one `grubby` command + reboot) |
| Edited a config and something broke | `hyprctl configerrors`, fix, `hyprctl reload` |
| Pressed `SUPER+Tab` and lost your desk | That bind also switches workspace (§2.5). Use `SUPER+CTRL+Tab` for group tabs |
| Keyboard layout skips one (us → kz) | Alt+Shift is handled by xkb **and** JaKooLit's `KeyboardLayout.sh`. If it double-steps, remove one of them (e.g. `kb_options` in `hyprland.conf`) |
| A floating window went off-screen | Focus it (`SUPER+CTRL+S`) and run `hyprctl dispatch centerwindow`, or press `SUPER+SHIFT+Space` twice |
